2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:05,508
One of the things that we ask you to do in

3
00:00:05,508 --> 00:00:08,647
this course a lot is to install software
from various places.

4
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:12,751
However if you use OS X Mavericks you'll
note it, you may notice that the default

5
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,127
installation has a couple of security
settings that

6
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:18,310
prevent you from just installing software
from the web.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,570
This is meant to protect you from

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,130
installing kind of bad or malicious
software.

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,670
But it can also prevent you from, from

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,560
installing things like RStudio and other
pieces of software.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,050
So in order to change those settings it's
fairly simple.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,250
You go to the Apple menu here.

13
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,110
And you click on System Preferences.

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,640
And then you want to go to Security &
Privacy.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,510
And by default you won't be able to make
any changes

16
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,360
before you, unless you type in your kind
of administrator password.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,246
So I'm going to click on the lock here,
type in my password, and now you

18
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,323
can see that there are a number of

19
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:51,100
options here for, for downloading and
installing apps.

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,630
So the safest option is to only allow, you

21
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,490
know, applications from the Mac App Store,
but there

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,120
are many things that we, you'll need to
download

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,120
for this course that aren't in the Mac App
Store.

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,620
So you need to click on the Anywhere
button.

25
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,250
That will allow you to install software
from the web or from anywhere.

26
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,760
And as long as it you, and it's your

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,710
responsibility to kind of, make sure that
the software is okay.

28
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,180
And so you'll need this to install things
like RStudio and GitHu, GitHub.

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,870
And other pieces of software.

30
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,320
So that's how you do that on the Mac.
