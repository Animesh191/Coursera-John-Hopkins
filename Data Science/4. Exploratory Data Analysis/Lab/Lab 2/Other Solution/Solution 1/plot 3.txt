#R Code for Project 2, plot 3
#Question: Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, 
#which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? 
#Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? 
# Data for plot previously downloaded to computer and loaded into R using provided
# code NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")

Balt <-subset(NEI, fips=="24510") #subset data for city of Baltimore Maryland

# Assumes library(plyr)is loaded - using ddply to summarize Total PM2.5 by year and type
new.df <- ddply(Balt, .(year, type), summarize,
                sum.PM2.5=sum(Emissions))

# Plot by type and add a simple trend line. Since this is exploratory analysis I am not any bells and whistles to this graph.
qplot(year,sum.PM2.5,data=new.df,facets=.~type,
      geom=c("point","smooth"),method="lm")

#Print plot
dev.copy(png,file="plot2-3.png")
dev.off()

#Answer: Downward trends in total emissions for Baltimore for 3 of 4 types.
