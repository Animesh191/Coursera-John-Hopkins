#R Code for Project 2, plot 5
#Question: How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
# Data for plot previously downloaded to computer and loaded into R using provided
# code NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")

#subset data for city of Baltimore Maryland and on-road type which represents motor vehicle sources
Balt <-subset(NEI, fips=="24510"& type=="ON-ROAD")

# Assumes library(plyr)is loaded - using ddply to summarize Total PM2.5 by year
new.df <- ddply(Balt, .(year, type), summarize,
                sum.PM2.5=sum(Emissions))

# Plot and add a simple trend line
plot(sum.PM2.5~year,new.df,xlab="Year",ylab="Total Emissions",main="Motor Vehicle Emissions - Baltimore")
model <- lm(sum.PM2.5~year,new.df) #fit a line to the data to see the trend
abline(model,lwd=2) #add the line to the plot

#Print plot
dev.copy(png,file="plot2-5.png")
dev.off()

#Answer: Downward trend in total emissions from motor vehicles sources, which we already knew from Question #3
