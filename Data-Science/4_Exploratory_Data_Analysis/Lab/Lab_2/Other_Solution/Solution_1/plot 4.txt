#R Code for Project 2, plot 4
#Question: Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999-2008?
# Data for plot previously downloaded to computer and loaded into R using provided code
# NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
# SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

#Determine the coal combustion-related sources by using any SCC short names with "Coal" in it
dt.Coal<-merge(data.table(NEI),SCC[grepl("Coal", SCC[,"Short.Name"]),],by="SCC",ignore.case=TRUE)

Coal <- with(dt.Coal,tapply(Emissions,year,sum)) #calculates total Emissions from all coal sources by year
Coal1 <- melt(Coal) #assumes library(reshape2) is active - converts Coal to a data.frame for easy plotting
with(Coal1,plot(Var1,value/(10^3),xlab="Year",ylab="Emissions - (000s)", main=expression("Total "* PM[2.5]*" Emissions - Coal Sources")))

model <- lm((value/(10^3))~Var1,Coal1) #fit a line to the data to see the trend
abline(model,lwd=2) #add the line to the plot

#Print plot
dev.copy(png,file="plot2-4.png")
dev.off()

#Answer: Downward trends in total emissions from coal sources.
